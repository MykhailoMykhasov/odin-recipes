            <li><!--Write steps here-->Peel the potatoes in the amount you plan to boil and wash well.</li>
            <li>Peel 1 large or 2 small onions.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into small cubes</li>
            <li>Cut the onion into small cubes.</li>
            <li>Put the potatoes in a saucepan and put the onions in it. Fill all the water so that the water barely covers the vegetables in the pan.</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat, bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are cooked.</li>
            <li>Pour the water in which the potatoes were cooked into a separate bowl. </li>
